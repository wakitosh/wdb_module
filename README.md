# WDB: Word-Database Module for Drupal

> Documentation note: A full Japanese explanation is provided in the latter half of this file. / 後半に日本語での詳細説明があります。

## 1. Overview

The Word-Database (WDB) Core module is a comprehensive toolkit for Drupal designed for linguists, historians, philologists, and digital humanists. A key feature of WDB is its flexibility, allowing for the management of **multiple linguistic materials from various eras and regions on a single, unified platform.**

At its core, the system allows users to perform granular annotations on high-resolution IIIF-compliant images, linking individual characters (signs) and words to detailed linguistic information. This deep data structure enables powerful searches, allowing users to **query textual information directly from the image context**. It features a rich user interface based on OpenSeadragon and Annotorious v3, a robust data import workflow, and deep integration with Drupal's core systems.

WDB is designed to transform digital image archives into structured, searchable, and interoperable linguistic databases, ready for scholarly research and public engagement.

## 2. Features

- **IIIF-Compliant Viewer & Editor:** A powerful and intuitive interface for viewing and annotating high-resolution images, built with OpenSeadragon and Annotorious v3.
- **Granular Annotation:** Supports detailed polygon annotations for individual characters (signs). **Word polygons are automatically calculated from these character sets**, enabling precise linguistic analysis.
- **Flexible Linguistic Data Import:** A batch import system for linguistic data using TSV files, complete with a rollback feature for safe data management.
- **Template Generation:** Automatically generate TSV templates from morphological analysis results (currently supporting **Japanese formats like WebChaMaMe's "Chaki import format"**) or from existing data within the system, significantly lowering the barrier to entry.
- **Dynamic Configuration & Access Control:** Manage all module and subsystem settings through a unified administrative UI. Configure whether to **make gallery and search pages public to anonymous users**, or **restrict access to members of a specific Drupal Group** for each collection.
- **IIIF Presentation API v3 Compliant:** Automatically generates IIIF Presentation API v3 manifests, including word-level annotations with rich, linked-data-ready descriptions, ensuring interoperability with external viewers like Mirador 3.
- **Customizable Data Export:** Export linguistic data in **TEI/XML and RDF/XML formats**. **Templates for these formats can be edited directly within the administrative UI**, allowing for user-defined output structures.
- **Deep Views Integration:** Full integration with Drupal's Views module allows site administrators to create completely customized search result pages and data listings without writing any code.
- **Extensible Entity Structure:** Built on Drupal's standard entity system. Site administrators can easily **add new fields to core data types like 'Source' and customize their display**, just like any other content type.
- **Optional Cantaloupe Integration:** An optional submodule provides a secure API endpoint to integrate with a Cantaloupe IIIF Image Server's delegate script, enabling control over **IIIF image access based on the user's login status on the Drupal site**.

## 3. Requirements

- **Drupal Core:** `^10` or `^11`
- **PHP:** `^8.1`
- **Required Drupal Modules (Enabled automatically by** `wdb_core.info.yml`**):**
  - Taxonomy, Content Translation, Language
  - File, Image
  - Field, Field UI
  - jQuery UI, jQuery UI Dialog
  - Group
- **Optional:**
  - **IIIF Image Server (Cantaloupe recommended)** (for serving your own images)

## 4. Installation

1. Navigate to your Drupal project's root directory.
2. Place the module directory in `/modules/custom`. *(Once published on Drupal.org, it can be installed via `composer require drupal/wdb_core`)*.
3. Enable the main module and any desired sub-modules via the Drupal UI (`/admin/modules`) or Drush:
```bash
   # Enable the core module (required)
   drush en wdb_core

   # Enable optional sub-modules as needed
   drush en wdb_core_views      # For Views integration
   drush en wdb_cantaloupe_auth # For Cantaloupe authentication
   drush en wdb_example         # For sample content
```
4. **Configure Private File System:** The linguistic data import feature requires Drupal's private file system.
   - Go to `Configuration > Media > File system` (`/admin/config/media/file-system`).
   - Set the "Private file system path" (e.g., `../private`) and save the configuration. Ensure this directory exists and is writable by the web server, but is not accessible directly from the web.
5. **Upon installation, the module will automatically:**
   - Add English and Japanese languages to the site if they do not exist.
   - Create the necessary Taxonomy vocabularies (Lexical Category, Grammatical Categories, etc.).
   - Create a default set of POS (Part-of-Speech) mapping rules.
6. Navigate to `/admin/people/permissions` and grant the "Administer WDB Core configuration" and other WDB-related permissions to the appropriate roles.

## 5. Usage Workflow

After installation, all WDB-related management pages are consolidated under the **WDB** menu item in the administration toolbar. Here is a typical workflow for setting up and using the system:

1. **Create a Subsystem:**
   - **Prerequisite:** Ensure the language for your data is available in Drupal. Go to `Configuration > Regional and language > Languages` (`/admin/config/regional/language`). If the language (e.g., Egyptian) does not exist, add it as a "Custom language".
   - **Create the Term:** Go to `Structure > Taxonomy > Subsystem` and create a new taxonomy term for your collection. Select the language for this subsystem.
2. **Configure the Subsystem:** Go to `WDB > Dashboard > Configuration > Module Settings`. In the tab for your new subsystem, configure the IIIF server details and access control settings.
   - **Important:** It is recommended to set the **IIIF Identifier Pattern** at this stage, before creating any `WDB Source` entities. This ensures that `image_identifier` values are generated correctly from the start. If you want to modify the `image_identifier` after creating the `WDB Source` entity (i.e., after the annotation page entity has been automatically created), enter the **IIIF Identifier Pattern** and click the **Apply pattern to existing pages in "{subsystem_name}"** button in the **Update Existing Pages** section.
  - **Identifier template syntax:** Available placeholders are `{source_identifier}`, `{page_number}`, `{page_name}`, and `{subsystem_name}`. You can append filters such as `{source_identifier|substr:0:8}` or `{source_identifier|substr:-4}` to extract slices (arguments follow PHP's `substr`: start plus an optional length, negative values allowed).
   - **IIIF Server Prefix:** Do not URL-encode this value.
   - **Allow anonymous access:** Check this to make the gallery and search pages for this subsystem public. Otherwise, users will need the "View non-public WDB gallery pages" or "Access WDB search form" permissions, respectively.
   - **Restrict via Drupal Group:** Optionally select a Drupal Group to limit access to its members. If the Group module is not installed, you can manually enter a Group UUID.
   - **Hull Concavity:** Controls the tightness of the auto-generated word polygon. A smaller value creates a tighter, more concave shape. However, `0` results in a convex hull.
3. **Define a Source:** Go to `WDB > Dashboard > Content Management > Manage Sources` and create a new `WDB Source` entity. Select the subsystem you just created.
4. **Update Annotation Pages:** When a new Source is created, Annotation Page entities are automatically generated based on the "Pages" field. Navigate to `WDB > Dashboard > Content Management > Manage Annotation Pages` to edit these pages and confirm the `image_identifier` has been generated correctly. You can also manually override it here if needed.
5. **View the Gallery:** At this point, you should be able to access the gallery page (`/wdb/{subsystem_name}/gallery/{source_identifier}/{page_number}`) and see the IIIF images.
6. **Annotate Characters:** In edit mode (`./edit`), draw polygons for each character. Enter a label for each polygon in the popup editor (e.g., a format like "line-character_sequence" like "1-1", "1-2" is recommended, but any readable text is acceptable).
7. **Prepare Linguistic Data:** Create your linguistic data in a TSV file. You can download a template from the "TSV Template Generator" tool (`WDB > Dashboard > Tools & Utilities`). The `example` module provides useful sample data. For Japanese, you can also generate a template directly from the output of a morphological analyzer like WebChaMaMe (Chaki import format). In that case, UniDic's part-of-speech system will be automatically mapped to WDB's lexical categories. The POS Mappings table is used for mapping. You can also modify the mapping as needed.
8. **Import Data:** Go to the Import Form (`WDB > Dashboard > Tools & Utilities > Import New Data`), select the language, upload your TSV file, and start the batch import.
9. **Verify:** Check the gallery page again. The linguistic data should now be displayed in the annotation panel, linked to the character polygons on the viewer.

## 6. Displaying Subsystem Titles

To display a prominent title for each subsystem (e.g., "Genji Monogatari Database") independently of the main site name, WDB Core provides a dedicated block. This is the recommended way to show visitors which collection they are currently viewing.

1. **Set the Title:** Go to `WDB > Dashboard > Configuration > Module Settings`. In each subsystem's tab, fill in the **Display Title** field with the full title you want to show for that collection.
2. **Place the Block:** Go to `Structure > Block layout` (`/admin/structure/block`). Click **Place block** in the region where you want the title to appear (e.g., Header or Content).
3. **Select the Block:** In the modal window, find and place the **WDB Subsystem Title** block.
4. **Configure the Block:** Uncheck the "Display title" option in the block's configuration form to prevent the block label from appearing.
5. **Theme Integration (Recommended):** For the best user experience, it is recommended to hide the default site name in your theme's settings and use this block as the primary title on WDB pages. The block will only appear on pages that belong to a subsystem, so it will not interfere with other parts of your site.

## 7. TSV File Format

The following columns are expected in the data import file. Fields marked with \* are mandatory.

- `source`\*: The "Source Identifier" of the WdbSource entity.
- `page`\*: The page number.
- `image_identifier`: *(Optional but recommended)* The IIIF image identifier for the page (the identifier part used in IIIF Image API URLs). Use this when a page needs an exception that cannot be expressed by the subsystem's **IIIF Identifier Pattern**.
  - If provided, the importer persists it on the corresponding Annotation Page.
  - If empty, the importer tries to generate and persist it from the subsystem pattern.
  - If the Annotation Page already has a stored value, it is not overwritten (a mismatch is reported as a warning).
- `labelname`\*: The label text entered for each polygon (e.g., "1-1").
- `sign`\*: The character symbol or code.
- `function`: The function of the character (e.g., phonogram, logogram).
- `phone`: The phonetic transcription of the character.
- `note`: A note about the character.
- `word_unit`\*: A numeric value to group characters into a word. All characters in the same word should have the same number. This value must be unique across the entire source document.
- `basic_form`\*: The lemma (dictionary form) of the word. A word is considered unique by the combination of its basic form and lexical category.
- `realized_form`: The actual form of the word as it appears in the text.
- `word_sequence`\*: The sequence number of the word in the document. This value must be unique across the entire source document.
- `lexical_category_name`\*: The part-of-speech name for the word. If a matching term does not exist in the "Lexical Category" taxonomy, a new one will be created.
- `meaning`\*: A numeric value to distinguish between multiple meanings of the same word.
- `explanation`: A description or gloss for the meaning.
- `verbal_form_name`, `gender_name`, `number_name`, `person_name`, `voice_name`, `aspect_name`, `mood_name`, `grammatical_case_name`: Names of grammatical categories. If a matching term does not exist in the corresponding taxonomy, a new one will be created.

## 8. Advanced Topics

### Cantaloupe IIIF Server Integration

The optional `wdb_cantaloupe_auth` submodule now ships with a signed token workflow that keeps IIIF tiles working even on browsers that block third-party cookies (Safari, Firefox strict mode, etc.). The legacy cookie-based fallback is still in place for logged-in sessions, so existing viewers continue to work during the transition.

#### Token-based authorization flow

1. When Drupal renders a gallery/editor page, `WdbDataService` issues a short-lived token via `wdb_cantaloupe_auth.token_manager` and exposes it in `drupalSettings.wdb_core.openseadragon.auth`.
2. When a subsystem requires authentication (i.e., **Allow anonymous access** is unchecked), every IIIF URL (info.json, tiles, thumbnails) is rewritten with a query parameter such as `?wdb_token=…`. Anonymous-friendly subsystems leave their IIIF URLs untouched so they can be consumed by third-party viewers without query strings.
3. Your reverse proxy forwards the original request URI and token to Cantaloupe via headers (`X-Original-URI`, `X-Original-URL`, `X-Wdb-Token`, etc.).
4. The Cantaloupe delegate script (see below) extracts the token/cookies, calls Drupal’s `/wdb/api/cantaloupe_auth` endpoint, and passes along the identifier.
5. Drupal validates the signature, expiration, and optional Drupal Group membership before returning `{"authorized": true/false}`. If no token is present it falls back to the historical cookie/session lookup so logged-in editors can still access tiles even before the token helper loads.

The default TTL is 600 seconds. After a user logs out, previously issued IIIF URLs continue to work until their token expires; shorten `token_ttl` if you need a stricter window. Logged-in editors remain authorized even if a token expires mid-session because the delegate falls back to their Drupal session cookies, so aggressive TTL values only impact anonymous/public traffic. The viewer also refreshes its token in the background while a page stays open, which lets you safely experiment with single-digit TTLs for anonymous users without booting active editors.

##### Manifest visibility and mixed-domain image servers

- The IIIF Presentation API v3 manifest route intentionally remains public so external viewers (Mirador, Universal Viewer, etc.) can load metadata without custom auth.
- `IiifV3ManifestController` only appends `wdb_token` to image URLs when the current viewer passes the subsystem's access policy. If the viewer lacks access, the manifest is still delivered but all same-domain tiles/images will 403 because they are missing a token.
- When a subsystem points at an image server on another domain that you do not control, the module cannot enforce access. Those URLs stay public even when the subsystem itself is group-restricted, so plan your deployment accordingly.

#### Drupal-side configuration

- Enable the submodule: `drush en wdb_cantaloupe_auth`.
- Configure each subsystem at `/admin/config/wdb/settings`:
  - Uncheck **Allow anonymous access** to require either a token or Drupal permissions.
  - Optionally select a Drupal Group in **Restrict via Drupal Group** (stored as UUID) to limit access to group members. If the Group module is not installed, you can paste a UUID instead.
- Token service settings live in `wdb_cantaloupe_auth.settings`. Adjust them via **WDB > Dashboard > Configuration > Cantaloupe authentication** (`/admin/config/wdb/cantaloupe-auth`) or Drush:

```bash
drush cget wdb_cantaloupe_auth.settings
drush cset wdb_cantaloupe_auth.settings token_ttl 600 -y
drush cset wdb_cantaloupe_auth.settings token_param wdb_token -y
```

Clear Drupal caches after changing the identifier pattern or access policy.

#### Reverse proxy requirements

Whatever sits in front of Cantaloupe (nginx, Apache, CDN, etc.) must forward the original IIIF URI plus the extracted query string, otherwise the delegate will never see `wdb_token`. At minimum set the following headers:

```nginx
location ^~ /iiif/ {
  proxy_pass http://cantaloupe:8182;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Original-URI $request_uri;
  proxy_set_header X-Original-URL $scheme://$host$request_uri;
  proxy_set_header X-Wdb-Token $arg_wdb_token;
}
```

For Apache/mod_proxy the equivalent looks like:

```apacheconf
# enablereuse keeps the backend connection alive across tiles; without it every
# tile opens a new TCP connection to Cantaloupe.
ProxyPass        /iiif/  http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/ nocanon enablereuse=on max=64 ttl=60 timeout=60
ProxyPassReverse /iiif/  http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/

RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Host  "%{HTTP_HOST}s"
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port  "%{SERVER_PORT}s"
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-For   "%{REMOTE_ADDR}s"
RequestHeader set X-Original-URI    "%{REQUEST_URI}s"
RequestHeader set X-Original-URL    "https://%{HTTP_HOST}s%{REQUEST_URI}s"
SetEnvIfExpr "req_query('wdb_token') =~ /.+/" wdb_token_qs=$0
RequestHeader set X-Wdb-Token "%{wdb_token_qs}e"
```

> Note: When the subsystem allows anonymous access there is no `wdb_token` query parameter, so the forwarded `X-Wdb-Token` header will be empty. Drupal still authorizes those requests automatically.

Adjust the upstream host/port to match your deployment (Docker service name, UNIX socket, load balancer, etc.). Prefer a loopback or private address over the site's public FQDN: routing the proxy hop back out through the public interface adds a DNS lookup and a network round trip to every tile.

##### Loopback vhost for the authorization endpoint

The delegate calls `/wdb/api/cantaloupe_auth` once per IIIF request. If that call goes to the public HTTPS URL, each tile pays for a TLS handshake plus an external round trip — measured at roughly 25–30 ms on a reference deployment, against about 7 ms to generate the tile itself. Give the image server a plain-HTTP loopback entrance instead:

```apacheconf
# Bound to 127.0.0.1 only, so it is unreachable from outside the host.
Listen 127.0.0.1:8080

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8080>
    ServerName wdb.example.org
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/wdb/web"
    DirectoryIndex index.php

    <Directory "/var/www/wdb/web">
        Options -Indexes -Includes
        AllowOverride All
        Require ip 127.0.0.1
    </Directory>

    # Make Drupal evaluate the request as if it arrived over HTTPS.
    SetEnv HTTPS on
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto https
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port 443
</VirtualHost>
```

Then point the delegate at it. `WDB_AUTH_HOST_HEADER` is required because Drupal resolves the site — and checks `trusted_host_patterns` — from the `Host` header, which would otherwise be `127.0.0.1`:

```ini
Environment="DRUPAL_AUTH_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8080/wdb/api/cantaloupe_auth"
Environment="WDB_AUTH_HOST_HEADER=wdb.example.org"
```

Note that a port 80 vhost redirecting to HTTPS will send the delegate a 301 rather than an authorization decision, which the delegate treats as "not authorized". Use a dedicated port as above rather than adding an exception to the redirect rule.

##### Caching IIIF responses at the proxy

IIIF responses are immutable for a given identifier and set of parameters, so they should be cached aggressively. Watch out for blanket `no-store` rules: a directive such as

```apacheconf
<Files ~ "\.(css|json|jpg)$">
    Header set Cache-Control no-store
</Files>
```

also matches `info.json` and every `default.jpg` tile, which disables IIIF caching entirely. Override it inside the proxy location:

```apacheconf
<Location /iiif/>
    # Do not use "Header always" here: always operates on err_headers_out and
    # cannot remove the Cache-Control the proxied response put in headers_out,
    # so you end up emitting the header twice.
    Header unset Cache-Control
    Header unset Pragma
    Header set Cache-Control "public, max-age=2592000, immutable"
    FileETag None
</Location>
```

Also enable HTTP/2 on the public vhost (`Protocols h2 http/1.1`). Loading `mod_http2` alone is not enough — without the `Protocols` directive Apache still answers HTTP/1.1, and a viewer's tile requests stay capped at the browser's six-connections-per-host limit.

#### Delegate script & local harness

- A sample delegate script is provided at `web/modules/custom/wdb_core/modules/wdb_cantaloupe_auth/scripts/delegates.rb`. It shows how to extract the token from `request_uri`, `request_headers`, and forwarded headers. Copy it into your Cantaloupe deployment (for example as `delegates.rb`, or `require_relative 'delegates'` from your existing delegate) and set `DRUPAL_AUTH_ENDPOINT`.
- **Do not delete the stub methods at the bottom of the sample.** Cantaloupe 5.x calls every method declared in its own `delegates.rb.sample` — `metadata`, `redactions`, `overlay`, `source`, and a dozen more. A method that is not defined raises `NoMethodError` inside JRuby, which Cantaloupe converts into an HTTP 500. A missing `metadata` breaks *every* `info.json` request while tiles keep working, which makes the failure look like a caching or manifest problem rather than a delegate one. When you upgrade Cantaloupe, diff your delegate against the new `delegates.rb.sample` and port over any newly added method.
- The delegate is configured entirely through environment variables:

  | Variable | Default | Purpose |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `DRUPAL_AUTH_ENDPOINT` | — | URL of `/wdb/api/cantaloupe_auth`. Prefer the loopback vhost above. |
  | `WDB_AUTH_HOST_HEADER` | unset | `Host` header to send. Required when the endpoint is a loopback address. |
  | `WDB_TOKEN_PARAM` | `wdb_token` | Query parameter carrying the token. |
  | `WDB_TOKEN_ONLY` | `false` | `true` disables the cookie/session fallback; only valid tokens authorize. |
  | `WDB_SKIP_AUTH_DIRS` | empty | Comma-separated identifier path segments served with no authorization check at all (e.g. `sample`). Use only for genuinely public material. |
  | `WDB_AUTH_CACHE_TTL` | `60` | Seconds to cache an authorization decision. `0` disables caching. |

- **Authorization caching.** One viewport pulls roughly twenty tiles and Cantaloupe calls the delegate for each, so without caching a single page view means twenty full Drupal bootstraps. The delegate caches each decision under a key covering the identifier, the token and the cookies, so a different user, token, or image never reuses another entry. The trade-off is that a decision can outlive the state it was based on by up to the TTL: after a logout or a token expiry, tiles for images the user had already opened keep loading for that long. Keep `WDB_AUTH_CACHE_TTL` well below `token_ttl` (default 600 s), or set it to `0` if you need revocation to take effect immediately.
- A CLI harness (`web/modules/custom/wdb_core/modules/wdb_cantaloupe_auth/scripts/delegate_harness.rb`) lets you test the flow without running Cantaloupe. It verifies delegate method coverage on every run, and can do that check on its own:

```bash
# Confirm every method Cantaloupe calls is defined (no Drupal contact).
ruby delegate_harness.rb --check-methods

# Full authorization round trip. Disable the cache so repeated runs against
# changing permissions are not masked.
DRUPAL_AUTH_ENDPOINT="https://wdb.example.org/wdb/api/cantaloupe_auth" \
WDB_AUTH_CACHE_TTL=0 \
  ruby delegate_harness.rb \
  --identifier wdb/hdb/bm10221/1.ptif \
  --request-uri "/iiif/3/.../default.jpg?wdb_token=<paste token>"
```

#### Verification & troubleshooting

- Cantaloupe writes detailed logs to `cantaloupe/logs/application.log`. A healthy request shows `:token=>"[redacted]"` in the payload and `{"authorized":true,"reason":"Token validated."}` from Drupal.
- If you only see `"reason":"No session cookie found."`, the token is not reaching the delegate—revisit your proxy headers.
- `NoMethodError: undefined method 'metadata' for #<CustomDelegate>` in the Cantaloupe error log, together with HTTP 500 on `info.json` while tiles still render, means the delegate is missing stub methods. Run `ruby delegate_harness.rb --check-methods` against your deployed copy.
- `Delegate pre_authorize error: Errno::ECONNREFUSED` means `DRUPAL_AUTH_ENDPOINT` is unreachable — commonly the loopback vhost is configured but Apache has not been restarted. The delegate denies the request (403) when it cannot reach Drupal.
- Configure Cantaloupe's `RollingFileAppender` rather than the plain `FileAppender`. The latter never rotates, and a delegate error that fires on every request will fill the disk quickly — a stack trace per request reached 1.2 GB of error log in one reference deployment.
- Tokens remain valid until the configured TTL. This is why an already-open tile URL still works for a few minutes after logout, whereas a bare (no-token) URL immediately returns 403 once the Drupal session ends. With `WDB_AUTH_CACHE_TTL` above zero, add that value to the window.
- Logged-in editors can still access IIIF URLs without tokens because the delegate falls back to session cookies. Disable that fallback only if you are ready to enforce tokens everywhere.
### **Export Template Variables**

The TEI/XML and RDF/XML export templates are rendered using Twig. The main data object available in the template is `page_data`. Below is a guide to its structure and the available variables.

* `page_data`
  * `.source`: The `WdbSource` entity object for the current document.
    * `{{ page_data.source.label() }}`: The display name of the source.
    * `{{ page_data.source.source_identifier.value }}`: The unique identifier of the source.
    * `{{ page_data.source.description.value }}`: The description of the source.
  * `.page`: The `WdbAnnotationPage` entity object for the current page.
    * `{{ page_data.page.label() }}`: The display label of the page (e.g., "p. 3").
    * `{{ page_data.page.page_number.value }}`: The page number.
    * `{{ page_data.page.getCanvasUri() }}`: A helper method to get the full IIIF Canvas URI for the page.
  * `.word_units`: An array of all word units on the page, sorted by their sequence. You can loop through this array:
    ```
    {% for item in page_data.word_units %}
      ...
    {% endfor %}`
    ```
    Each `item` in the loop contains:
    * `item.entity`: The `WdbWordUnit` entity object.
      * `{{ item.entity.realized_form.value }}`: The realized form.
      * `{{ item.entity.word_sequence.value }}`: The sequence number.
      * To access related data, you can traverse the entity references:
        * `{% set word_meaning = item.entity.word_meaning_ref.entity %}`
        * `{% set word = word_meaning.word_ref.entity %}`
        * `{{ word.basic_form.value }}`
        * `{{ word.lexical_category_ref.entity.label() }}`
    * `item.sign_interpretations`: An array of `WdbSignInterpretation` entities that make up this word unit, sorted by their sequence within the word.
      * `{% for si in item.sign_interpretations %}`
      * `{{ si.phone.value }}`
      * `{% set sign_function = si.sign_function_ref.entity %}`
      * `{% set sign = sign_function.sign_ref.entity %}`
      * `{{ sign.sign_code.value }}`


## **9\. For Developers**

### **Entity Relationships**

The WDB module is built upon a rich set of custom content entities. The primary relationships are as follows:

* **WdbSource** (A document) has many **WdbAnnotationPage**s.
* **WdbWordUnit** (A word in context) appears on one or more **WdbAnnotationPage**s.
* **WdbWordUnit** is linked to a single **WdbWordMeaning**.
* **WdbWordMeaning** belongs to a single **WdbWord** (the lemma).
* **WdbWord** is classified by a **Lexical Category** (Taxonomy Term).
* **WdbWordUnit** is composed of one or more **WdbSignInterpretation**s, linked via the **WdbWordMap** entity.
* **WdbSignInterpretation** is linked to a **WdbLabel** (the annotation polygon) and a **WdbSignFunction**.
* **WdbSignFunction** belongs to a single **WdbSign** (the character).

### **Design Notes**

*Optional Sign Function Name*

`WdbSignFunction.function_name` is intentionally optional. If it is left blank the generated `sign_function_code` becomes `<sign_code>_` (a trailing underscore). Two safeguards enforce logical uniqueness:

1. A composite uniqueness validator on `(langcode, sign_ref, function_name)` treats an empty string as a real value so duplicate blank entries for the same Sign + language are rejected before hitting the database.
2. An additional validator step predicts the final `sign_function_code` and blocks duplicates (relevant when `function_name` is blank or identical).

Rationale: During early data creation and TSV preparation, researchers (often in the humanities rather than computational specialists) may not yet wish to categorise every sign function. Allowing an empty value lowers friction while still guaranteeing stable identifiers and preventing silent duplication. This is analogous—but not identical—to `WdbWordMeaning`, where `meaning_identifier` is required but `explanation` is optional.

If a future project phase requires making the function name mandatory, it can be flipped to required without breaking existing codes; existing blank entries already yield consistent `sign_function_code` values.

### **Key Services**

* `wdb_core.data_importer` **(**WdbDataImporterService**):** Handles the logic for parsing TSV files and creating/updating entities in batch.

## 1. 概要

Word-Database (WDB) Core モジュールは、言語学者、歴史学者、文献学者、そしてデジタル・ヒューマニティーズの研究者のために設計された、Drupal のための包括的なツールキットです。WDB の最も重要な特徴は、その柔軟性です。さまざまな時代や地域の複数の言語資料を、単一の統一されたプラットフォーム上で取り扱うことができます。

このシステムの中核となるのは、IIIF に準拠した高精細画像に対して詳細なアノテーションを付与し、個々の文字（sign）や単語（word）を、詳細な言語情報と結びつける機能です。この深いデータ構造により、画像上の文脈から直接テキスト情報を検索する、といった強力な検索が可能になります。OpenSeadragon と Annotorious v3 をベースにしたリッチなユーザーインターフェース、堅牢なデータ投入ワークフロー、そして Drupal のコアシステムとの深い統合を特徴としています。

WDB は、デジタル化された画像アーカイブを、学術研究と公開活用のための、構造化され、検索可能で、相互運用性の高い言語データベースへと変換するために設計されています。

## 4. インストール

1. Drupalプロジェクトのルートディレクトリに移動します。
2. モジュールディレクトリを `/modules/custom` に配置してください。（将来的にDrupal.orgで公開された場合は `composer require drupal/wdb_core` でインストールできます。）
3. Drupalの管理画面（`/admin/modules`）またはDrushを使って、メインモジュールと、必要に応じてサブモジュールを有効化します:
```bash
   # コアモジュールを有効化（必須）
   drush en wdb_core

   # 必要に応じてオプションのサブモジュールを有効化
   drush en wdb_core_views      # Views連携機能
   drush en wdb_cantaloupe_auth # Cantaloupe認証連携
   drush en wdb_example         # サンプルコンテンツ
```
4. **プライベートファイルシステムの設定:** 言語データのインポート機能は、Drupalのプライベートファイルシステムを使用します。
   - `環境設定 > メディア > ファイルシステム` (`/admin/config/media/file-system`) に移動します。
   - 「プライベートファイルシステムパス」を設定し（例: `../private`）、設定を保存してください。このディレクトリは、Webサーバーから書き込み可能で、かつWebから直接アクセスできない場所にある必要があります。
5. **インストール時の挙動:** モジュールを有効化すると、以下の初期設定が自動的に行われます。
   - サイトに英語と日本語が（もしなければ）追加されます。
   - 語彙範疇（Lexical Category）や文法カテゴリー（Grammatical Categories）のタクソノミーボキャブラリーが生成されます。
   - 品詞マッピングの初期ルールが作成されます。
6. `/admin/people/permissions` に移動し、「Administer WDB Core configuration」や、その他のWDB関連の権限を、適切な役割（ロール）に割り当ててください。

## 5. 使い方：基本的なワークフロー

インストール後、WDB関連の全ての管理ページは、管理ツールバーの **WDB** メニュー項目に集約されます。以下に、典型的な作業の流れを示します。

1. **サブシステムの作成:**
   - **事前準備:** 扱うデータの言語がDrupalに登録されていることを確認します。`環境設定 > 地域・言語 > 言語` (`/admin/config/regional/language`) に移動してください。もし言語（例: エジプト語）が存在しない場合は、「カスタム言語を追加」から言語コード（例: egy）を指定して作成します。
   - **タームの作成:** `サイト構築 > タクソノミー > Subsystem` に移動し、資料群に対応する新しいタクソノミータームを作成します。この時、その資料群の主要言語として、先ほど準備した言語を選択します。
2. **サブシステムの設定:** `WDB > ダッシュボード > 設定 > モジュール設定` に移動します。新しく作成したサブシステムのタブを開き、IIIF画像サーバの情報や資料の公開方法などを設定します。
   - **重要:** `image_identifier`を正しく自動生成するために、この段階で **IIIF Identifier Pattern** を設定することを推奨します。この設定は、`WDB Source` **エンティティを作成する前**に行ってください。`WDB Source`エンティティ作成後（すなわちアノテーションページエンティティが自動作成された後）に`image_identifier`を修正したい場合には、**IIIF Identifier Pattern**を入力した上で、**Update Existing Pages**セクションの **Apply pattern to existing pages in {subsystem_name}** ボタンをクリックしてください。
  - **識別子テンプレート構文:** 利用できるプレースホルダーは `{source_identifier}`、`{page_number}`、`{page_name}`、`{subsystem_name}` です。さらに `{source_identifier|substr:0:8}` や `{source_identifier|substr:-4}` のように `|substr` フィルタを付与して部分文字列を抽出できます（引数は PHP の `substr` と同じで、開始位置＋任意の長さ。負の値も使用可能）。
   - **IIIF Server Prefix:** URLエンコードは不要です。
   - **Allow anonymous access:** これにチェックを入れると、このサブシステムのギャラリーページと検索フォームが匿名ユーザーに公開されます。チェックを外した場合、それぞれ「View non-public WDB gallery pages」または「Access WDB search form」の権限が必要になります。初期状態では非公開です。
   - **Restrict via Drupal Group:** 特定の Drupal Group のメンバーのみにアクセスを制限したい場合に選択します。Group モジュールがインストールされていない場合は、Group UUID を直接入力することも可能です。
   - **Hull Concavity:** 文字の集合から単語のポリゴンを生成する際の、座標の密着度（凹みの大きさ）を制御します。値が小さいほど凹みが大きくなります（ただし、0で凸包）。
3. **資料情報の定義:** `WDB > ダッシュボード > コンテンツ管理 > 資料の管理` に移動し、新しい `WDB Source` エンティティを作成します。先ほど作成したサブシステムを選択してください。
4. **アノテーションページの更新:** 新しい資料を作成すると、そのページ数分のアノテーションページエンティティが自動生成されます。`WDB > ダッシュボード > コンテンツ管理 > アノテーションページの管理` に移動し、`image_identifier`が正しく生成されていることを確認します。必要であれば、ここで個別に値を上書きすることも可能です。
5. **ギャラリーページの確認:** ここまでの設定が完了すると、`/wdb/{サブシステム名}/gallery/{資料ID}/{ページ番号}` というURLでギャラリーページにアクセスし、IIIF画像が表示されるはずです。
6. **アノテーションの作成:** 編集モード (`./edit`) に切り替え、ツールバーのボタンを使ってポリゴンを描画します。各ポリゴンには、"1-1"（行番号-文字順）のような、ページ内でユニークなラベル名を入力します。
7. **言語データの準備:** システム外で言語データを作成します。`WDB > ダッシュボード > ツールとユーティリティ > TSVテンプレート生成` から、テンプレートとなるTSVファイルをダウンロードできます。`example`モジュールを有効化すると、サンプルデータも利用できます。日本語の場合は、形態素解析済みテキスト（Web茶まめが出力するChakiインポート用形式のフォーマット）をアップロードして、テンプレートを生成することも可能です。その場合、UniDicの品詞体系はWDBの語彙範疇に自動的にマッピングされます。マッピングにはPOS Mappingsテーブルが使われます。必要に応じてマッピングを修正することも可能です。
8. **言語データの投入:** `WDB > ダッシュボード > ツールとユーティリティ > データ新規取込` フォームで、作成したTSVファイルをアップロードします。
9. **最終確認:** 再度ギャラリーページにアクセスし、ポリゴンと言語データが正しく結びついて表示されることを確認します。

## 6. サブシステム・タイトルの表示

各サブシステム（資料群）のタイトル（例: 「源氏物語データベース」）を、サイト全体のサイト名とは独立して表示するために、WDB Coreは専用のブロックを提供します。これは、訪問者に現在どの資料群を閲覧しているかを伝えるための推奨される方法です。

1. **タイトルの設定:** `WDB > ダッシュボード > 設定 > モジュール設定` に移動します。各サブシステムのタブで、**Display Title** フィールドに、その資料群で表示したい正式なタイトルを入力します。
2. **ブロックの配置:** `サイト構築 > ブロックレイアウト` (`/admin/structure/block`) に移動します。タイトルを表示したい領域（例: ヘッダーやコンテンツ）の **ブロックを配置** ボタンをクリックします。
3. **ブロックの選択:** モーダルウィンドウで **WDB Subsystem Title** ブロックを探し、配置します。
4. **ブロックの設定:** ブロックの設定フォームで、「タイトルを表示」のチェックを外すと、ブロックのラベルが表示されず、`<h1>`タグで囲まれたタイトルだけが表示されるため、すっきりとします。
5. **テーマとの連携（推奨）:** 最適なユーザー体験のためには、テーマの設定でデフォルトのサイト名を非表示にし、このブロックをWDB関連ページのメインタイトルとして使用することをお勧めします。このブロックは、サブシステムに属するページでのみ表示されるため、サイトの他の部分には影響を与えません。

## 7. TSVファイルの各カラムの書式について

データ投入用のTSVファイルは、以下のカラムで構成されます。\* が付いている項目は必須です。

- `source`\*: 資料名。WdbSourceエンティティの「Source Identifier」と一致させる必要があります。
- `page`\*: ページ番号。
- `image_identifier`: （任意。ただし推奨）ページ画像の IIIF 画像識別子（IIIF Image API の URL に使われる identifier 部分）です。サブシステム設定の **IIIF Identifier Pattern** だけでは表現できない例外ページがある場合に、TSV側で明示します。
  - TSV に値がある場合、インポータは該当アノテーションページに保存します。
  - TSV が空の場合、インポータはサブシステムのパターンから生成して保存します。
  - すでにアノテーションページに値が保存されている場合は上書きしません（不一致は warning として記録します）。
- `labelname`\*: ラベル名。各ポリゴンに入力した "1-1" 等のテキストと一致させる必要があります。
- `sign`\*: 文字記号あるいは文字コード。
- `function`: 文字の機能（例: phonogram, logogram）。
- `phone`: 文字の発音・音写。
- `note`: 文字に関する注記。
- `word_unit`\*: 単語のまとまりを表す数値。同じ単語に属する文字には、同じ数値を付与します。この値は、資料全体でユニークである必要があります。
- `basic_form`\*: 単語の基本形（見出し語）。同形異語は、`lexical_category_name`との組み合わせで区別されます（同じ形かつ同じ品詞ならば同じ語と見なされます）。
- `realized_form`: 単語の実現形。資料上で実際に出現している形。
- `word_sequence`\*: 資料内での単語の並び順。この値は、資料全体でユニークである必要があります。
- `lexical_category_name`\*: 単語の品詞名。「語彙範疇」タクソノミータームとして登録されます（存在しない場合は新規作成）。日本語翻訳名を入力することも可能です。
- `meaning`\*: 単語の語義を表す数値。同一語に複数の語義がある場合は、この数値で区別します。
- `explanation`: 語義の説明（語釈）。
- `verbal_form_name`, `gender_name`, `number_name`, `person_name`, `voice_name`, `aspect_name`, `mood_name`, `grammatical_case_name`: 各種文法カテゴリー名。「文法カテゴリー」タクソノミータームとして登録されます（存在しない場合は新規作成）。

## 8. 高度なトピック

### Cantaloupe IIIF画像サーバとの連携

オプションの `wdb_cantaloupe_auth` サブモジュールには、サイン付きトークンを利用した新しい認証フローが追加されました。Safari や Firefox のトラッキング防止で Cookie が送信されなくても IIIF タイルを配信できます。既存のクッキーベース判定も残しているため、ログイン済みユーザーのワークフローはそのままです。

#### トークンベースの認証フロー

1. Drupal がギャラリー／エディタページを描画する際、`WdbDataService` が `wdb_cantaloupe_auth.token_manager` 経由で短命トークンを発行し、`drupalSettings.wdb_core.openseadragon.auth` に書き込みます。
2. サブシステムで匿名アクセスを禁止している場合（Allow anonymous access をオフにしている場合）は、生成されるすべての IIIF URL (info.json、タイル、サムネイル) に `?wdb_token=...` のようなクエリを付与します。匿名アクセスを許可しているサブシステムでは URL を書き換えず、そのまま外部ビューアで利用できます。
3. リバースプロキシは、元のリクエスト URI とトークンを `X-Original-URI` や `X-Wdb-Token` ヘッダーとして Cantaloupe に転送します。
4. Cantaloupe の delegate スクリプトがトークン／Cookie を取り出し、Drupal の `/wdb/api/cantaloupe_auth` エンドポイントに POST します。
5. Drupal は署名・有効期限・必要であれば Drupal Group メンバーシップを検証し、`{"authorized": true/false}` を返します。トークンが無い場合は従来の Cookie のみで照合します。

標準のトークン TTL は 600 秒です。ログアウト後もしばらくタイルが表示されるのは、発行済みトークンが期限切れになるまで有効だからです。より厳格にしたい場合は `token_ttl` を短くしてください。なお、ログイン中の編集者はトークンの有効期限が切れても Drupal セッション Cookie へのフォールバックで継続して認可されるため、TTL を極端に短くしても影響を受けるのは匿名／公開アクセスのみです。また、ビューアはページを表示したままでも自動的に新しいトークンを取得するため、編集者の作業を中断させずに短い TTL を試すことができます。

##### マニフェスト公開と異なるドメインの画像サーバー

- Mirador や Universal Viewer など外部ビューアから参照できるよう、IIIF Presentation API v3 のマニフェスト URL は常に公開のままとしています。
- `IiifV3ManifestController` は、閲覧者が当該サブシステムのアクセスポリシーを満たした場合のみ IIIF URL に `wdb_token` を付与します。権限がない閲覧者でもマニフェスト自体は取得できますが、同一ドメイン上のタイルや画像はトークン無しのため 403 で止まります。
- 逆に、別ドメイン（外部組織や公開 CDN など）の IIIF サーバーを指すサブシステムでは、wdb_core 側でアクセス制御を強制できません。その場合は画像 URL が常に公開扱いとなる点に注意してください。

#### Drupal 側の設定

- `drush en wdb_cantaloupe_auth` でサブモジュールを有効化します。
- `/admin/config/wdb/settings` で各サブシステムを設定します。
  - **Allow anonymous access** のチェックを外すと、トークンまたは Drupal 権限が必須になります。
  - **Restrict via Drupal Group** に Drupal Group を選択すると（内部的にはUUIDを保存）、そのグループ所属者だけがアクセスできます。Groupモジュールが未導入の場合は、UUIDを直接入力してください。
- トークンサービスの詳細設定は `wdb_cantaloupe_auth.settings` に保存されます。**WDB > ダッシュボード > 設定 > Cantaloupe authentication** (`/admin/config/wdb/cantaloupe-auth`) から変更するか、以下の Drush コマンドを利用してください:

```bash
drush cget wdb_cantaloupe_auth.settings
drush cset wdb_cantaloupe_auth.settings token_ttl 600 -y
drush cset wdb_cantaloupe_auth.settings token_param wdb_token -y
```

識別子パターンやアクセス方針を変更した後は `drush cr` でキャッシュをクリアしてください。

#### リバースプロキシの要件

nginx や Apache など、Cantaloupe の前段にあるプロキシは、オリジナルの IIIF リクエストと `wdb_token` を必ずヘッダーで渡す必要があります。最低限、以下のように設定してください。

```nginx
location ^~ /iiif/ {
  proxy_pass http://cantaloupe:8182;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Original-URI $request_uri;
  proxy_set_header X-Original-URL $scheme://$host$request_uri;
  proxy_set_header X-Wdb-Token $arg_wdb_token;
}
```

Apache (mod_proxy) の例:

```apacheconf
# enablereuse でバックエンド接続を使い回します。これが無いとタイル 1 枚ごとに
# Cantaloupe への TCP 接続を張り直します。
ProxyPass        /iiif/  http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/ nocanon enablereuse=on max=64 ttl=60 timeout=60
ProxyPassReverse /iiif/  http://127.0.0.1:8182/iiif/

RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Host  "%{HTTP_HOST}s"
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port  "%{SERVER_PORT}s"
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-For   "%{REMOTE_ADDR}s"
RequestHeader set X-Original-URI    "%{REQUEST_URI}s"
RequestHeader set X-Original-URL    "https://%{HTTP_HOST}s%{REQUEST_URI}s"
SetEnvIfExpr "req_query('wdb_token') =~ /.+/" wdb_token_qs=$0
RequestHeader set X-Wdb-Token "%{wdb_token_qs}e"
```

> 補足: Allow anonymous access をオンにしているサブシステムでは `wdb_token` クエリ自体が付与されないため、転送される `X-Wdb-Token` ヘッダーは空になります。その場合でも Drupal 側で自動的に許可されます。

上流ホスト名やポート番号は実際の環境に合わせて変更してください。プロキシ先にはサイトの公開 FQDN ではなくループバックやプライベートアドレスを指定してください。公開インターフェースへ折り返すと、タイル 1 枚ごとに DNS 解決とネットワーク往復が余分に発生します。

##### 認可エンドポイント用のループバック vhost

delegate は IIIF リクエスト 1 件ごとに `/wdb/api/cantaloupe_auth` を呼びます。この呼び出しが公開 HTTPS URL を経由すると、タイルごとに TLS ハンドシェイクと外部往復のコストがかかります。ある実環境での実測では **1 リクエストあたり約 25〜30ms** で、タイル生成そのもの（約 7ms）より大きなコストでした。画像サーバ用に平文 HTTP のループバック入口を用意してください。

```apacheconf
# 127.0.0.1 にのみバインドするため、ホスト外部からは到達できません。
Listen 127.0.0.1:8080

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8080>
    ServerName wdb.example.org
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/wdb/web"
    DirectoryIndex index.php

    <Directory "/var/www/wdb/web">
        Options -Indexes -Includes
        AllowOverride All
        Require ip 127.0.0.1
    </Directory>

    # Drupal に HTTPS 経由のリクエストとして評価させます。
    SetEnv HTTPS on
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto https
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port 443
</VirtualHost>
```

delegate 側はここを向けます。Drupal は `Host` ヘッダーからサイトを解決し `trusted_host_patterns` を検査するため、`WDB_AUTH_HOST_HEADER` の指定が必須です（指定しないと `127.0.0.1` になってしまいます）。

```ini
Environment="DRUPAL_AUTH_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8080/wdb/api/cantaloupe_auth"
Environment="WDB_AUTH_HOST_HEADER=wdb.example.org"
```

なお、ポート 80 の vhost が HTTPS へリダイレクトしている場合、delegate には認可結果ではなく 301 が返り、「認可されなかった」と扱われます。リダイレクト規則に例外を追加するのではなく、上記のように専用ポートを用意してください。

##### プロキシでの IIIF レスポンスのキャッシュ

IIIF のレスポンスは識別子とパラメータで一意に定まる不変コンテンツなので、積極的にキャッシュすべきです。ここで注意が必要なのが、一律の `no-store` 指定です。たとえば

```apacheconf
<Files ~ "\.(css|json|jpg)$">
    Header set Cache-Control no-store
</Files>
```

は `info.json` と全タイル（`default.jpg`）にも一致してしまい、IIIF のキャッシュを完全に無効化します。プロキシの Location 側で打ち消してください。

```apacheconf
<Location /iiif/>
    # ここで "Header always" を使わないこと。always は err_headers_out を操作する
    # ため、プロキシ応答が headers_out に載せた Cache-Control を消せず、
    # ヘッダが 2 本出力されてしまいます。
    Header unset Cache-Control
    Header unset Pragma
    Header set Cache-Control "public, max-age=2592000, immutable"
    FileETag None
</Location>
```

併せて公開 vhost で HTTP/2 を有効化してください（`Protocols h2 http/1.1`）。`mod_http2` をロードしただけでは不十分で、`Protocols` ディレクティブが無いと Apache は HTTP/1.1 で応答し続け、ビューアのタイル取得はブラウザの「同一ホスト 6 接続」制限に張り付いたままになります。

#### Delegate スクリプトとローカルハーネス

- サンプルの delegate は `web/modules/custom/wdb_core/modules/wdb_cantaloupe_auth/scripts/delegates.rb` に含まれています。`request_uri` や転送ヘッダーからのトークン抽出方法が実装されています。Cantaloupe の環境にコピー（例えば `delegates.rb` として設置、または既存 delegate から `require_relative 'delegates'`）し、`DRUPAL_AUTH_ENDPOINT` を設定してください。
- **サンプル末尾のスタブメソッド群を削除しないでください。** Cantaloupe 5.x は自身の `delegates.rb.sample` に宣言されたメソッドをすべて呼び出します（`metadata`、`redactions`、`overlay`、`source` ほか十数個）。未定義のメソッドがあると JRuby 内で `NoMethodError` が発生し、Cantaloupe はこれを HTTP 500 に変換します。特に `metadata` が欠けていると、タイルは正常に返るのに **`info.json` だけがすべて 500 になる** ため、delegate ではなくキャッシュやマニフェストの問題に見えてしまいます。Cantaloupe をアップグレードした際は、新しい `delegates.rb.sample` と差分を取り、追加されたメソッドを必ず移植してください。
- delegate の設定はすべて環境変数で行います。

  | 変数 | 既定値 | 用途 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `DRUPAL_AUTH_ENDPOINT` | — | `/wdb/api/cantaloupe_auth` の URL。上記のループバック vhost を推奨 |
  | `WDB_AUTH_HOST_HEADER` | 未設定 | 送信する `Host` ヘッダー。エンドポイントがループバックアドレスの場合は必須 |
  | `WDB_TOKEN_PARAM` | `wdb_token` | トークンを載せるクエリパラメータ名 |
  | `WDB_TOKEN_ONLY` | `false` | `true` で Cookie／セッションのフォールバックを無効化し、有効なトークンのみを許可 |
  | `WDB_SKIP_AUTH_DIRS` | 空 | 認可チェックを一切行わずに配信する識別子のパス要素（カンマ区切り、例 `sample`）。本当に公開してよい資料にのみ使用してください |
  | `WDB_AUTH_CACHE_TTL` | `60` | 認可結果をキャッシュする秒数。`0` でキャッシュ無効 |

- **認可結果のキャッシュ。** 1 画面で約 20 枚のタイルが読み込まれ、Cantaloupe はその 1 枚ごとに delegate を呼ぶため、キャッシュが無いと 1 ページ表示で Drupal のフルブートストラップが 20 回走ります。delegate は識別子・トークン・Cookie を含むキーで判定結果をキャッシュするので、利用者・トークン・画像が異なれば別エントリになります。トレードオフとして、**判定結果は根拠となった状態より最大 TTL 秒だけ長く生き残ります**。ログアウトやトークン失効の後も、すでに開いていた画像のタイルはその間だけ表示され続けます。`WDB_AUTH_CACHE_TTL` は `token_ttl`（既定 600 秒）より十分に小さく保つか、失効を即座に反映させたい場合は `0` にしてください。
- Cantaloupe を起動せずに試せる CLI ハーネス `web/modules/custom/wdb_core/modules/wdb_cantaloupe_auth/scripts/delegate_harness.rb` も用意しています。実行のたびに delegate のメソッド網羅性を検査し、その検査のみを行うこともできます。

```bash
# Cantaloupe が呼ぶメソッドがすべて定義されているか確認（Drupal には接続しません）
ruby delegate_harness.rb --check-methods

# 認可の往復を含む確認。権限を変えながら繰り返し試す場合は
# キャッシュを無効化してください。
DRUPAL_AUTH_ENDPOINT="https://wdb.example.org/wdb/api/cantaloupe_auth" \
WDB_AUTH_CACHE_TTL=0 \
  ruby delegate_harness.rb \
  --identifier wdb/hdb/bm10221/1.ptif \
  --request-uri "/iiif/3/.../default.jpg?wdb_token=<貼り付けたトークン>"
```

#### 動作確認とトラブルシューティング

- Cantaloupe のログ (`cantaloupe/logs/application.log`) に `:token=>"[redacted]"` が出ていれば、delegate までトークンが届いています。Drupal 側は `{"authorized":true,"reason":"Token validated."}` を返します。
- `"reason":"No session cookie found."` しか表示されない場合は、プロキシがヘッダーを付与できていない可能性があります。
- Cantaloupe のエラーログに `NoMethodError: undefined method 'metadata' for #<CustomDelegate>` が出て、タイルは表示されるのに `info.json` だけ 500 になる場合は、delegate のスタブメソッドが不足しています。設置済みのファイルに対して `ruby delegate_harness.rb --check-methods` を実行して確認してください。
- `Delegate pre_authorize error: Errno::ECONNREFUSED` は `DRUPAL_AUTH_ENDPOINT` に到達できないことを示します。ループバック vhost を追加したのに Apache を再起動していない場合によく起きます。delegate は Drupal に到達できないとき、そのリクエストを拒否（403）します。
- Cantaloupe のログは `FileAppender` ではなく `RollingFileAppender` を設定してください。前者はローテーションを行わないため、毎リクエストで発生する delegate エラーがあると急速にディスクを圧迫します（ある実環境ではエラーログだけで 1.2GB に達していました）。
- トークンは TTL が切れるまで有効です。ログアウト後もしばらくタイルが表示されるのはこのためです。`WDB_AUTH_CACHE_TTL` を 0 より大きくしている場合は、その秒数がさらに加算されます。
- トークンなしの URL でも、Drupal にログインしているブラウザからのアクセスであればセッション Cookie によるフォールバックで許可されます。完全にトークンのみとしたい場合は、delegate スクリプト側でフォールバックを無効化してください。

### エクスポート用テンプレートの変数

TEI/XMLおよびRDF/XMLのエクスポート用テンプレートは、Twigを使ってレンダリングされます。テンプレート内で利用可能な主要なデータオブジェクトは `page_data` です。以下にその構造と利用可能な変数についてのガイドを示します。

- `page_data`
  - `.source`: 現在の資料の `WdbSource` エンティティオブジェクト。
    * `{{ page_data.source.label() }}`: 資料の表示名。
    * `{{ page_data.source.source_identifier.value }}`: 資料のユニークなID。
    * `{{ page_data.source.description.value }}`: 資料の説明。
  - `.page`: 現在のページの `WdbAnnotationPage` エンティティオブジェクト。
    * `{{ page_data.page.label() }}`: ページの表示ラベル（例: "p. 3"）。
    * `{{ page_data.page.page_number.value }}`: ページ番号。
    * `{{ page_data.page.getCanvasUri() }}`: このページの完全なIIIF Canvas URIを取得するヘルパーメソッド。
  - `.word_units`: ページ上の全ての単語ユニットを、出現順にソートした配列。この配列をループ処理できます:
    ```twig
    {% for item in page_data.word_units %}
      ...
    {% endfor %}
    ```
    ループ内の各 `item` は、以下の情報を含みます:
    * `item.entity`: `WdbWordUnit` エンティティオブジェクト。

## 9. 開発者向け情報

### エンティティの関係性

WDBモジュールは、豊富なカスタムコンテントエンティティ上に構築されています。主要な関係性は以下の通りです。

- **WdbSource** (資料) は、多数の **WdbAnnotationPage** を持ちます。
- **WdbWordUnit** (文脈中の単語) は、一つ以上の **WdbAnnotationPage** に出現します。
- **WdbWordUnit** は、単一の **WdbWordMeaning** に結びつきます。
- **WdbWordMeaning** は、単一の **WdbWord** (見出し語) に属します。
- **WdbWord** は、**Lexical Category** (タクソノミーターム) によって分類されます。
- **WdbWordUnit** は、一つ以上の **WdbSignInterpretation** から構成され、**WdbWordMap** エンティティを介して結びつきます。
- **WdbSignInterpretation** は、**WdbLabel** (アノテーションのポリゴン) と **WdbSignFunction** に結びつきます。
- **WdbSignFunction** は、単一の **WdbSign** (文字) に属します。

### 設計ノート: Sign Function の function_name が任意である理由

`WdbSignFunction.function_name` フィールドは、TSV 作成や初期投入時の負担軽減を優先し「必須ではない」設計としています。未入力（空文字）の場合、生成される `sign_function_code` は `<sign_code>_` （末尾アンダースコア）となります。これは **一時的に機能ラベルを未確定のまま識別子だけ確保したい** という人文学系ワークフローを想定しています。

重複防止は二段構えで保証されます:

1. `(langcode, sign_ref, function_name)` の複合一意性バリデーション（空文字も実際の値として扱い、同一 Sign + 言語で複数の空 function_name を禁止）。
2. 生成前に予測される `sign_function_code`（`<sign_code>_` など）での追加重複チェック。

これにより、function_name を後から追記しても識別子の一貫性が損なわれず、同時に空のままの重複行が静かに増殖することを防ぎます。将来的に要件が変わり必須化したい場合は、フィールドを required に変更するだけで、既存データの識別子（`sign_function_code`）はそのまま利用できます。

参考: `WdbWordMeaning` では `meaning_identifier` を必須とし `explanation` を任意とする対称ではない設計ですが、Sign Function 側は「まず最小限の符号機能エンティティを大量投入 → 後で機能名を意味的に整理」という運用を想定したためこの差異があります。

### 主要なサービス

- `wdb_core.data_service` (**WdbDataService**): アノテーションパネルやシステムの他の部分のために、データを取得し、構造化するための中核的なサービス。
- `wdb_core.data_importer` (**WdbDataImporterService**): TSVファイルを解析し、バッチ処理でエンティティを作成・更新するロジックを担います。
- `wdb_core.template_generator` (**WdbTemplateGeneratorService**): TSVテンプレートを生成するロジックを担います。

### モジュールの拡張

このモジュールは、拡張性を考慮して設計されています。例えば、`hook_entity_insert()`のような標準的なDrupalのフックを使い、新しい`subsystem`タクソノミータームが作成された際の処理（デフォルト設定の作成など）を実装しています。

### APIエンドポイント

クライアント側の幾何ユーティリティを支援するため、読み取り専用の軽量APIを提供します。いずれも GET でアクセスし、JSON を返します。クエリ文字列で JSON を渡す場合は URL エンコードが必要です（以下の例はエンコード済み）。

- GET `/wdb/api/hull`
  - 目的: 任意の点集合に対する凹包（concave hull）を計算します。
  - クエリパラメータ:
    - `points`（必須）: `"X,Y"` 形式の文字列からなる JSON 配列。例: `["10,20","30,40","25,35"]`。
    - `concavity`（任意・整数）: 凹みの強さ（小さいほどきつい。ただし0で凸包の意味＝ゆるさ最大）。値が大きいほど外形がゆるくなります。デフォルト: `20`。
  - レスポンス: 2次元点の配列 `[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...]`（数値）。
  - エラー: `points` が不足・不正な場合は `400` と `{ "error": "..." }` を返します。
  - URL例:
    - 凹包（concavity=20）:
      `/wdb/api/hull?points=%5B%2210%2C20%22%2C%2230%2C40%22%2C%2225%2C35%22%2C%2215%2C22%22%5D&concavity=20`
    - 凸包（concavity=0）:
      `/wdb/api/hull?points=%5B%2210%2C20%22%2C%2230%2C40%22%2C%2225%2C35%22%2C%2215%2C22%22%5D&concavity=0`

- GET `/wdb/api/bbox`
  - 目的: 任意の点集合の軸平行バウンディングボックスを計算します。
  - クエリパラメータ:
    - `points`（必須）: `"X,Y"` 形式の文字列からなる JSON 配列。
  - レスポンス: `{ x, y, w, h }`（左上 `(x,y)`、幅 `w`、高さ `h`）。値は整数に丸められ、`w`/`h` は最低でも `1` となります。
  - エラー: `points` が不足・不正な場合は `400` と `{ "error": "..." }` を返します。
  - URL例:
    `/wdb/api/bbox?points=%5B%2210%2C20%22%2C%2230%2C40%22%2C%2225%2C35%22%2C%2215%2C22%22%5D`
